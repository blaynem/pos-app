# Still in Development

I'm still in the process of developing the app pretty frequently. So anything you see now is definitely not a finished product.

## Reason for creating:

### Problem

A club was writing down all of their club patrons orders on a slip of paper. Everything from drinks, food, their club dues, etc. Nothing was on the internet, simply a piece of paper. If that paper was lost, so was all of their information.

### Solution

Allow them to do exactly the same thing they were doing previously, but now it's on the internet and easier to use/keep track of. Will give patrons the ability to go online and check what they've purchased in the last month at the club, and keep track of that information.


## Try it out

Clone or download this rep. Inside of the folder directory, run `npm install` and then run `npm start`. Your browser should open to a localhost, and you'll be able to add things to a cart.

### To use

After downloading, just click an item you want to add to the cart, and it'll be there. (Will need to update as project expands.)


## Todo

- Add ability to add to specific user.
- Add ability to add users.
- Make all of the information blocked unless you have the information to sign in with.
- Ability for users to see their carts - via sign in type thing.
- Add more todo things.

## Difficulties and things learned.

Wrapping my head around multiple stores applying to each other.

## Bugs

- Will update as I come across more bugs.
